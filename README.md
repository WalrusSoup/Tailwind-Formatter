# Tailwind Formatter

Tailwind formatter is a port of [Headwind](https://github.com/heybourn/headwind) for use with Intellij/Phpstorm/Webstorm. It enforces consistent ordering of classes by parsing your code and reprinting class tags to follow a given order.

Code -> Run Tailwind Formatter

Hotkey -> Shift + Ctrl + H

## Class Order
The default class order is available under `src/resources/classes.txt`. Custom classes will automatically be pushed to the back
of the class list. Duplicated classes will also be removed.

The order given is following the recommended standard, which is as they appear in [the generated css](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted).

## Customizing Sort Order
Create a `.tailwindorder` configuration file in the root of your project that contains a list of classes as you wish them to appear.

Example: 

```
bg-red-500
p-4
h-15
mx-2
```

Due to size restrictions, please consult the plugins `resources/classes.txt` for a full list of classes as generated by the Tailwind CLI.

## Building The Plugin
Plugin Configuration: `GradeJVM\SDK: Amazon Corretto 11`

## Building Updated Classes
Building updated classes is much more straight forward than painfully going through the docs. It's not elegant, but it works.
```sh
cd tailwind
npm install
# If you need to generate the default configuration again, Or consult the default stub https://unpkg.com/browse/tailwindcss@3.1.8/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js 
npx tailwind init --full
# This generates a full classes.css file
npx tailwindcss build -o classes.css
# This parses it and extracts the necessary classes we need into classes.txt
node generate.js
# From there, copy paste classes.txt in resources to update internal list
```
