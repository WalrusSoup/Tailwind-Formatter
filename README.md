# Tailwind Formatter
<!-- Plugin description -->
Tailwind formatter sorts classes according to recommended ordering (as it appears in CSS), without the aggressiveness of prettier. It enforces consistent ordering of classes by parsing your code and reprinting class tags to follow a given order.

## Features
* Customize class ordering with a `.tailwindorder` file
* Publish the default recommended order via the dropdown menu

Code -> Run Tailwind Formatter

Hotkey -> Shift + Ctrl + H

## Class Order
The default class order is available under `src/resources/classes.txt`. Custom classes will automatically be pushed to the back
of the class list. Duplicated classes will also be removed.

The order given is following the recommended standard, which is as they appear in [the generated css](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted).

## Customizing Sort Order
Create a `.tailwindorder` configuration file in the root of your project that contains a list of classes as you wish them to appear. If you simply want to move a few, then I recommend publishing the default configuration first.

Example: 

```
bg-red-500
p-4
h-15
mx-2
```

Due to size restrictions, please consult the plugins `classes.txt` for a full list of classes as generated by the Tailwind CLI.

## Development 


### Updated Classes
Building updated classes is much more straight forward than painfully going through the docs. It's not elegant, but it works.
```sh
cd tailwind
npm install
# If you need to generate the default configuration again, Or consult the default stub https://unpkg.com/browse/tailwindcss@3.1.8/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js 
npx tailwind init --full
# This generates a full classes.css file
npx tailwindcss build -o classes.css
# This parses it and extracts the necessary classes we need into classes.txt
node generate.js
# From there, copy paste classes.txt in resources to update internal list
```
